# THLabel

THLabel is a subclass of UILabel, which additionally allows shadow blur, inner shadow, stroke text and fill gradient.

## Requirements

* iOS 4.0 or higher (below iOS 7.0 is untested though)
* ARC enabled

## Installation

The easiest way to use THLabel in your app is via [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/ "CocoaPods").

1. Add the following line in the project's Podfile file: `pod 'THLabel', '~> 1.4.4'`
2. Run the command `pod install` from the Podfile folder directory.

### Manual Installation

1. Add `CoreText.framework` to your *Link Binary with Libraries* list.
2. Drag these files into your project: `THLabel.h`, `THLabel.m`

## Usage

You can create THLabels programmatically, or create them in Interface Builder by dragging an ordinary UILabel into your view and setting its *Custom Class* to THLabel.

## Properties

``` objective-c
	@property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat letterSpacing;
```

You can modify the letter spacing of the text (also known as kerning) by changing the `letterSpacing` property. The default value is `0.0`. A positive value will separate the characters, whereas a negative value will make them closer.

``` objective-c
	@property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat shadowBlur;
```

Additionally to UILabel's `shadowColor` and `shadowOffset`, you can set a shadow blur to soften the shadow.

``` objective-c
	@property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat innerShadowBlur;
	@property (nonatomic, assign) CGSize innerShadowOffset;
	@property (nonatomic, strong) UIColor *innerShadowColor;
```

The inner shadow has similar properties as UILabel's shadow, once again additionally with a shadow blur. If an inner shadow and a stroke are overlapping, it will appear beneath the stroke.

``` objective-c
	@property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat strokeSize;
	@property (nonatomic, strong) UIColor *strokeColor;
	@property (nonatomic, assign) THLabelStrokePosition strokePosition;
```

You can set an outer, centered or inner stroke by setting the `strokePosition` property. Default value is `THLabelStrokePositionOutside`. Other options are `THLabelStrokePositionCenter` and `THLabelStrokePositionInside`.

``` objective-c
	@property (nonatomic, strong) UIColor *gradientStartColor;
	@property (nonatomic, strong) UIColor *gradientEndColor;
	@property (nonatomic, copy) NSArray *gradientColors;
```

The gradient can consist of multiple colors, which have to be saved as UIColor objects in the `gradientColors` array. For more convenience, `gradientStartColor` and `gradientEndColor` will fill up the array accordingly.

``` objective-c
	@property (nonatomic, assign) CGPoint gradientStartPoint;
	@property (nonatomic, assign) CGPoint gradientEndPoint;
```

The starting and ending points of the gradient are in the range 0 to 1, where (0, 0) is the top-left and (1, 1) the bottom-right of the text. The default value for `gradientStartPoint` is (0.5, 0.2) and for `gradientEndPoint` it is (0.5, 0.8).

``` objective-c
	@property (nonatomic, assign) THLabelFadeTruncatingMode fadeTruncatingMode;
```

You can fade in/out your label by setting the `fadeTruncatingMode` property. Default value is `THLabelFadeTruncatingModeNone`. The options are `THLabelFadeTruncatingModeTail`, `THLabelFadeTruncatingModeHead` and `THLabelFadeTruncatingModeHeadAndTail`.

``` objective-c
	@property (nonatomic, assign) UIEdgeInsets textInsets;
	@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL automaticallyAdjustTextInsets;
```

Effects like stroke and shadow can't be drawn outside of the bounds of the label view. You may need to set text insets to move a bit away from the edge so that the effects don't get clipped. This will be automatically done if you set `automaticallyAdjustTextInsets` to YES, which is also the default value.

## Notes

THLabel respects (unlike UILabel) the `contentMode` property, which is used for vertical alignment. The `textAlignment` still has the higher priority, when it comes to horizontal alignment.

THLabels are slower to draw than UILabels, so be aware of that.

Big thanks to Jason Miller for showing me sample code of his implementation using Core Text! It inspired me to dig deeper and move away from drawing with NSAttributedString on iOS 7, which caused a lot of problems.
